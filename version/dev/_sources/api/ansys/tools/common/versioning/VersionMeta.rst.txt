Method detail
-------------

.. py:method:: __le__(__x: Union[str, int]) -> bool

   Less equal.

   If compared against a string which contains 'dev' it will always evaluate to True.
   If compared against an int, it will perform a classic 'less equal' operation.


.. py:method:: __lt__(__x: Union[str, int]) -> bool

   Less than.

   If compared against a string which contains 'dev' it will always evaluate to True.
   If compared against an int, it will perform a classic 'less than' operation.


.. py:method:: __ge__(__x: Union[str, int]) -> bool

   Greater equal.

   If compared against a string which contains 'dev' it will always evaluate to False.
   If compared against an int, it will perform a classic 'greater equal' operation.


.. py:method:: __gt__(__x: Union[str, int]) -> bool

   Greater than.

   If compared against a string which contains 'dev' it will always evaluate to False.
   If compared against an int, it will perform a classic 'greater than' operation.


.. py:method:: __eq__(__x: object) -> bool

   Equal method.

   If compared against a string which contains 'dev' it will always evaluate to False.
   If compared against an int, it will perform a classic 'equal' operation.


.. py:method:: __ne__(__x: object) -> bool

   Not equal.

   If compared against a string which contains 'dev' it will always evaluate to not
   'equal' operation (True). If compared against an int, it will perform a classic 'not equal' operation.


.. py:method:: __hash__() -> int

   Call the underlying __hash__ method.
